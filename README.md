### Project 2: Lending Club

#### Assignment Summary
LendingClub was founded in 2007 and headquartered in San Francisco, California. It operated as a peer-to-peer lending platform that allowed individuals and small businesses to borrow money directly from investors. The platform used technology to assess borrowersâ€™ creditworthiness, helping determine interest rates. Investors could browse available loans and choose which ones to fund based on factors like credit rating, loan term, and loan purpose. The dataset for the project includes information on loans issued through LendingClub as explained below.

The dataset LC_train.csv Download LC_train.csv has information on a sample of 100,000 loans pulled from this website from 2007 to 2020. Some of these variables were recorded at the time the borrowers applied for the loan (i.e., at loan origination), while others reflect the loan status as of the month the data was pulled - these are indicated by the term "current" in the variable descriptions. The accompanying data dictionary file, LCDataDictionary.xlsx provides detailed definitions.

In this assignment, you will analyze the a modified version of the LendingClub dataset (which only includes variables gathered at the loan origination time), train models to predict the interest rates of the loans, submit a report of your findings. You are required to model the interest rate using the LC_HW2.csv
